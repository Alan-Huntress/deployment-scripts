# Automate (LabTech) script for re-installing the Huntress Agent.

**NOTE:** In most cases, you do not need to use this script. This script is meant to re-install the Huntress Agent. It does not check if the Huntress Agent is already installed. If run repeatedly (e.g. on a schedule), it will keep re-installing the agent.
